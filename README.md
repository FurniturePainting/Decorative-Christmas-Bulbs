Do you have old Christmas glass balls that need an update? Are they making your Christmas Tree dull and lonely? Worry not, here is an amazing painting technique that will surely build your confidence and make your Christmas balls fun and colorful! 

I started with my glass Christmas ornaments by removing the top hook holder. Then mixed 50% of Floetrol and 50% of Dixie Belle Moonshine Metallics. After that I poured the paint in swirling motion to create a marble effect and it is really fun to do! I left them dry overnight and added some ribbon to hang.
